# Future Scope Notes

> Comment for future planning (no implementation in this change):

1. Add a **no-model version** that is limited, but still retains key features.
2. Update how **API keys are stored** and add support for **more model providers/models**.
3. Evolve this into a **simple, lightweight application** for easier day-to-day use.
